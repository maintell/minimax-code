/**
 * Account-quota recovery policy for `usage_limited` Goals.
 *
 * A Goal stopped by an exhausted account quota is not a failure the user has to
 * repair: the quota itself recovers at a wall-clock time the provider tells us.
 * This module owns the single decision "may this Goal continue on its own, and
 * when" so the Host scheduler and the durable store answer it identically. A
 * manual resume is never refused on its account: resuming before the reset is
 * a real attempt that may succeed (credits, a plan upgrade).
 *
 * Two rules keep the automation honest:
 *
 *   1. Only an *explicit account quota* stop qualifies. A bare 429, an unknown
 *      BYOK error or any other provider failure has no trustworthy recovery
 *      time, so it is never auto-resumed.
 *   2. Only a *trustworthy* recovery time qualifies. A missing, past, absurdly
 *      distant or non-integral timestamp is discarded rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: the same inputs must produce the same decision in
 * the settlement path, in the scheduler and after a restart.
 */
/**
 * Longest recovery time this project will schedule against.
 *
 * The account windows that produce a recoverable stop are a rolling five-hour
 * window and a rolling weekly window, so a trustworthy reset is always inside a
 * week. The extra day absorbs clock skew and provider rounding without letting
 * a corrupt or malicious timestamp park a Goal indefinitely.
