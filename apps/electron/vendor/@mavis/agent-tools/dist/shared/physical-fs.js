 * archive handle for the life of the process and prevent Windows recycling it.

 * Keep this boundary local to tool I/O: Node module loading and application
 * assets still need Electron's regular fs. Never toggle the process-global
 * noAsar flag around asynchronous work. original-fs is an Electron built-in,
 * not an npm dependency; ordinary Node (TUI/cloud) retains its normal fs.
