 * True when changing anything before an assistant turn invalidates that turn's
 * signed thinking. Every request builder protects such a model in one of two
 * ways, both decided here:
 *
 * - Keep the request prefix unchanged: no request-only image placeholders and
 *   no compaction triggered by request bytes alone, so images leave history
 *   only when a compaction replaces it.
 * - When a request necessarily has another prefix (the isolated checkpoint
 *   request has its own system prompt and no tools), drop the thinking whose
 *   signature can no longer verify.
 *
 * The flag declared on the model wins; without one, the Messages API model
 * family is recognised by its model id (direct, Bedrock or behind a gateway).
