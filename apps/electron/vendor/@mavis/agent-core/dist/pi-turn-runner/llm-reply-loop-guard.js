// A model can fall into a loop it never leaves: its reasoning goes on as
// "Now." "Writing." "Go." "Let me write." "OK." … with a word or two changing
// between rounds, until the reply's token limit. The guard reads
// the reply's reasoning and text as they stream and says when either has become
// such a loop, so the stream can be ended with an error instead of running on.
//
// The reply is cut into units, its lines and sentences. A loop is a long run of
// units that are nearly all the same few: of the last LOOP_WINDOW units of a
// channel, no more than LOOP_DISTINCT different ones. Code, a table, a list or a
// log differ line to line in their names, numbers and cells, and a unit with no
// word and no emoji in it (a brace, a rule, a row of hex or numbers) is not
// counted at all. An emoji counts as a word: a reply stuck emitting the same
// emoji (#592) is a loop like any other. A loop with no break in it
// ("mcp mcp mcp …", "🤯🤯🤯…") is read on its own once a unit grows to
// UNIT_MOST characters.
