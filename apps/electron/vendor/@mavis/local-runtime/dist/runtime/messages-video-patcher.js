/**
 * `buildMessagesVideoPatcher` — pi-ai `onPayload` hook that flips
 * `image` content blocks whose source MIME starts with `video/` into
 * `video` content blocks before the HTTP request leaves local-runtime.
 *
 * **Why this exists**
 *
 * pi-ai's modality enum is `('text' | 'image')[]` — there is no `video`
 * input slot. Local-runtime carries video attachments (either
 * user-attached in the inbound message or produced by the `read` tool
 * on a video file) as `ImageContent` records with `mimeType=video/*` so
 * they ride the same multimodal codepath as images; pi-ai then
 * serializes them into the Messages API as standard `image` content
 * blocks (`{type:'image', source:{media_type:'video/...'}}`).
 *
 * The official endpoint rejects video media types in image blocks (HTTP 400).
 * DashScope and other Messages-compatible providers
 * accept a `video` block with the same `source` shape but `type:'video'`.
 * This patcher rewrites just the `type` discriminator on blocks whose
 * `source.media_type` starts with `video/`, leaving everything else
 * untouched.
 *
 * **Relation to cloud-runtime**
 *
 * This is a byte-for-byte functional twin of
 * `packages/cloud-runtime/src/host/pi-session/messages-video-patcher.ts`.
 * The two runtimes do not currently share a runtime-patcher package (the
 * openplatform-thinking-patcher pair has already diverged), so we keep
 * a local copy instead of reaching across package boundaries. If you
 * change the payload rewrite rule, update both files.
 *
 * **Wire safety**
 *
 * - Patcher returns the (mutated) payload only when at least one block
 *   actually changed; otherwise returns `undefined` so pi-ai keeps the
 *   original reference (no copy on the no-op path).
 * - `model` argument is read for `api` identification — the patcher
 *   only fires when the resolved model uses the fixed Messages-compatible API discriminator.
 *   Other providers (openai-chat, ...) pass through unchanged.
 * - Failure-open: if the payload doesn't match the expected Messages
 *   shape, patcher returns undefined without throwing — better to ship
 *   the unmodified payload than to crash the LLM call.
 *
 * **Capability gate**
 *
 * Caller installs this patcher only when the active model declares
 * `support_video=true` on its capabilities. Without that gate, a model
 * may receive video blocks and return HTTP 400; with it,
 * the gate ensures the model is one of the providers (DashScope, etc.)
 * that accept the rewritten `video` block.
