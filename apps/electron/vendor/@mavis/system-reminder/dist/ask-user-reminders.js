/**
 * AskUser model-visible reminders: the `<ask-user-policy>` declaration (all
 * models) and the `<ask-user-guidance>` block (managed models only).
 *
 * Both are injected into the Turn's user-message prefix and therefore persist
 * in conversation history; every later request re-sends them. So instead of
 * re-injecting each Turn, the host passes the runtime-owned text of earlier user
 * messages and we inject only when history does not already carry the needed
 * block. This also self-heals after summary compaction (`llm_checkpoint`), which
 * drops every injected block, and after process restarts, which would reset any
 * in-memory Turn counter.
 *
 * Detection matches the complete runtime-rendered block text, never a tag-name
 * substring: a user quoting `<ask-user-policy>` in chat must not be mistaken for
 * a runtime declaration. The host narrows the scanned text further to the
 * runtime-owned prefix of each user message.
 *
 * Pure module: no IO, no logging. Every decision carries a stable reason code so
 * the host can log why a block was (not) injected.

 * `block` / `skip` / `auto`: texts confirmed by the user on 2026-09-24.

 * instead of returning at once. Keep every text verbatim; changing a single
 * character makes previously injected declarations undetectable and triggers

/**
 * Question timing and quality guidance for managed models.
 *
 * Why each rule is worded the way it is:
 * - Only timing and question quality, never sync/async: `async` usage lives in
 *   the tool description every model sees, so repeating it here would let the
 *   two drift apart.
 * - The first rule lists when asking is required. In the 2026-10-13 Ask User
 *   v2 eval, 10 of the 40 cases that should ask made no ask_user call: the
 *   model chose a direction that changes the deliverable itself (meeting
 *   purpose, job level, handling path, contracting party). The previous first
 *   rule only said when not to ask and never said when asking is required.
 *   Its closing "do not ask for what is already stated" keeps the 18
 *   should-not-ask cases from being triggered by the wider list.
 * - "A default is reasonable only if a wrong guess costs the user nothing":
 *   models treated "the file can be rewritten" as reversible, so they built a
 *   whole deliverable on a guessed direction, or built several versions at
 *   once (Chinese, bilingual and English) to avoid choosing.
 * - "Whenever you need the user's decision or material": widens the previous
 *   "if the user asks you to confirm first, call ask_user" rule, because the
 *   eval also had models requesting material in reply text without creating a
 *   questionnaire. A question written in reply text shows the user nothing to
 *   answer.
 * - "Check that the answers would let you finish": 3 cases did call ask_user
 *   but asked only how to send material, what to name the assistant, or which
 *   tone to use, and missed scope, stop conditions and permissions, so the
 *   model would have had to ask again or guess.
 * - "Every question needs 2–4 options": the ask_user schema requires `options`
 *   on every question. The previous wording ("For each question with options")
 *   read as if options were optional, and models wrote option-less fill-in
 *   questions that then failed schema validation.
 * - Lengths (200 characters per question; 50 per option, label and description
 *   counted together) are recommendations only. By the user's decision of
 *   2026-10-12 there is deliberately no `maxLength` or other enforcement in the
 *   schema; the old "explain every consequence and the recommendation" wording
 *   produced 47–103 character option descriptions, so the prompt now asks for
 *   brevity instead.
 * - "It marks your suggestion, not the user's answer": `recommended` only
 *   highlights an option; it must not be read as the user having approved it.
 *
 * `hasAskUserGuidance` matches this full text, so any wording change makes
 * existing sessions miss it once and get the new version re-injected on their
 * next Turn. That single re-injection is expected.
